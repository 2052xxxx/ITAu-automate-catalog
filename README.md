# Automate Updates to Catalog Information

A final project from Google IT Automation Course 6.

1. Created a Python script that processed the images and descriptions. 
2. Updated your company's online website to add the new products.
3. Create PDF attached with the name of the fruit and its total weight (in lbs).
3. Once the task was complete, the supplier was *notified* with an email that indicated the total weight of fruit (in lbs) that were uploaded, with PDF attached.  
5. Finally, in parallel to the automation running, we wanted to check the health of the system and send an email if something goes wrong.
